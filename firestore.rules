/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CityFind.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes authorization independence by avoiding `get()` calls and enforcing path-based ownership.
 * All write operations require authentication and are restricted based on the document path.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database is structured as follows:
 * - /categories/{categoryId}: Stores category information. Publicly readable.
 * - /businesses/{businessId}: Stores business information. Publicly readable.
 * - /businesses/{businessId}/products/{productId}: Stores product information for businesses. Publicly readable.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Stores order information. Publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: All collections (`categories`, `businesses`, `products`, `orders`) are publicly readable.
 * - No User Accounts: Since the application uses anonymous authentication, there are no user-specific collections or ownership-based restrictions.
 * - Write Restrictions: Write access is denied to all clients due to the absence of user accounts and defined write roles.
